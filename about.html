<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At the end of the day, my previous job entailed managing people, leading a team, and ensuring that tasks were completed on time. <br /> I'm the colleague at work that everybody wants to know but nobody wants to be. If you want to get something done, you come to me-everyone knows that! Yet no one wants to have to do what <br /> i do because of the among of personal time and effort that goes into being everyone's go-to.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I'm obsessed with staying organized and making everyone's life easier. It brings me genuine joy to take the burden off my<br />  loved ones' shoulders, and I always do everything I can to improve that. Work is no exception. There aren't many things that can grow a business like trust and dependability, and I take pride in being <br /> so committed to both.</p>

<p>I just concluded my MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain at the University of Hull in England. <br /> I was previously employed as a project manager at homeland design (an interior design firm) with prior experience as a creative designer at the same company.</p>

<p>I have an entrepreneurial mindset and am eager to learn and adapt to new situations. <br /> I am looking for opportunity in project management in the United Kingdom.</p>
